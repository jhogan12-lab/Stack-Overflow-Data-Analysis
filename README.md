# StackOverflowDataAnalysis
This is a brief project focusing on data analysis and visualization from the Stack Overflow developers survey from 2019, 2020 and 2021

I utilized a few packages in Python, namely Pandas, CSV, and Collections. You will see I certainly did not need to use two different import methods, but I am still a beginner in Python and Data Analysis/Visualization so I wanted to practice some new concepts and put them into practical use.

Please note I am not attempting to make any thesis or conclusion with this data. This was solely for my practice and to become a better programming.

Also note this survey does not encompass all users of Stack Overflow. The survey was also completely anonymous, so no personal identifying information can be extracted from the original data files.
